<p>Highlighting the role of IT in healthcare, Rahul Rastogi, CEO and Founder, Agatsa said, “Technology plays an important role in the digitisation of healthcare. Moreover, COVID -19 has accelerated the pace of its adoption and use. Not only healthcare, but also radiology, diagnostics, medical technology, and health insurance have reaped the benefits of this technology. Physicians and patients have also benefited from the ever-changing technology. Digital health solutions have been developed and implemented to enable providers to save costs and time, help patients take control of their health data, and allow stakeholders to change their business models to include more personalised treatments for patients.”</p>

<p>“In addition, technology has proven to be very effective in detecting, managing, and curing various diseases that were once tedious tasks. Before the introduction of technology, there were cases of misdiagnosis due to human error. However, with technology, these can be eliminated through accurate and instant diagnosis. AI is being used in oncology to detect cancer; machine learning applications help accurately detect disease in bleeding tissues. In addition, many complex procedures are supported by AI-driven robots”</p>
