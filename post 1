<p>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of preventable blindness in infants and children worldwide. India is experiencing an ROP epidemic, significantly impacting rural districts. Furthermore, it is projected that the myopia epidemic will affect 50 per cent of the global population by 2050.</p>

<p>The prevalence of myopia in children in India has quadrupled in the past twenty years. Active prevention and mitigation strategies are needed to control and potentially reverse both the ROP and myopia trends currently seen in India.</p>
